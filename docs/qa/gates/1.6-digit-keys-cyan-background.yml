story_title: "Digit keys cyan background"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Digits (0–9) and decimal correctly use cyan scheme and cyan focus ring; operators/actions remain blue. However, base state uses bg-cyan-500 with text-white which likely fails WCAG 2.1 AA 4.5:1 contrast for body-sized text, risking Lighthouse a11y <95. Recommend either darkening the base cyan (e.g., bg-cyan-700) or switching text color to a dark foreground on bg-cyan-500, then update hover/active tokens and tests."

top_issues:
  - "Contrast concern: bg-cyan-500 + text-white likely <4.5:1 (AA) for normal text."
  - "Lighthouse a11y ≥95 cannot be guaranteed until contrast is corrected and validated."
