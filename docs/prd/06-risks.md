# 6. Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------|
| Complex dark mode | Early contrast testing |
| Mobile perf drops | Reduced-motion query |
| Shortcut conflicts | Scoped listeners |
| Focus visibility on cyan keys | Add focus-visible ring with offset; manual QA across themes |
| Cyan contrast fails in some states | Use text-white; verify hover/active shades meet AA |
