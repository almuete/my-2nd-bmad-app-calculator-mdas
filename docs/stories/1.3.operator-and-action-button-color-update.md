# Story 1.3: Operator/Action button color update

## Status
Done

## Story
As a calculator user, I want operator and action buttons styled in the blue palette so the UI is consistent with the design update.

### Client request
- Source: Client UI change — “Change all orange buttons to light blue”
- Palette: Tailwind blue (`600` base, `500` hover, `700` active)
- Scope: Calculator-only; buttons currently using orange

### Scope
- In scope: `operator` and `action` keys in calculator (`components/calculator/Key.tsx`)
- Out of scope: Any non-calculator buttons or global orange elements; numeric keys remain unchanged

## Acceptance Criteria (Checklist)
- [x] Operator/action keys use Tailwind `blue-600` (base), `blue-500` (hover), `blue-700` (active), in light/dark themes.
- [x] Focus-visible ring remains clearly visible; meets WCAG AA contrast.
- [x] Numeric keys unchanged; no logic/handlers changed (visual styling only).
- [x] Visual snapshots updated; unit tests pass; Lighthouse a11y ≥95.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- DEV: Update `components/calculator/Key.tsx` (operator/action variants to blue)
- DEV: Update tests and snapshots
