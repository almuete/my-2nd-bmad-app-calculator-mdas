# Story 1.5 — Keypad Reorder and Dot Position

## Summary
Reorder numeric keypad to display digits in descending order (9 → 0) left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and position the decimal point to the immediate right of digit 0 in the last row. No changes to operators/actions or keyboard behavior.

## Rationale
- Aligns with client request for keypad layout change.
- Preserves existing accessibility, visual style (glassmorphism), and keyboard mapping.

## Acceptance Criteria
- 4-column grid maintained.
- Digits render 9..0 in descending order left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
- Decimal point sits to the right of 0 in the final row.
- ARIA labels remain accurate (e.g., "Digit 9", "Decimal point").
- Tab order follows visual order; keyboard input unaffected.
- Unit tests pass; visual snapshots updated for Desktop & Mobile; QA gate passes.

## Impacted Artifacts
- `components/calculator/Keypad.tsx`
- Unit tests: `tests/KeypadComponents.test.tsx`
- Visual tests: `tests/visual/calculator.spec.ts` and snapshots
- Docs: `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`, stakeholder release notice (if applicable)

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Visual regressions on small screens → Mitigation: update and review visual snapshots.
- Risk: Tab order mismatch → Mitigation: ensure DOM order matches visual order.

## Definition of Done
- All ACs met; QA gate for 1.5 passes; release notes updated.
