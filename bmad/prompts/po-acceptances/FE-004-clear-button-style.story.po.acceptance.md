## Decision: Approve

## Findings: brief notes per AC
- Default: `C` shows orange background with white text on `/calculator` — Pass.
- Hover: lighter orange with white text — Pass.
- Active: darker orange — Pass.
- Focus-visible: ring-based, no layout shift — Pass.
- Disabled (if applicable): reduced emphasis, no interaction — Pass.
- Keyboard parity (`Escape` clears) and focus-visible — Pass.
- No layout shifts on interaction — Pass.
- Other keypad buttons unchanged — Pass.

## Required Changes: concrete edits if any (file paths, what to adjust)
- None.

## Notes: optional remarks (perf/a11y/risks)
- Keep focus indication via ring/outline to avoid CLS (already implemented).
- If product design later introduces contrast targets, verify default and hover across themes.*** End Patch*** }```Eҩassistant 和盛 to=functions.apply_patch_PENDING Exception: Could not parse arguments as JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)%timeoutassistant to=functions.apply_patchാര്യ жәson ырғаjson code block error.
