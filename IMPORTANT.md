I have new task from the client what BMAD command should I run first?
  
  - Recommended first command: *advanced-elicitation — to capture the client task’s scope, goals, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

  Other common paths:
  - If you already have enough detail: *create-next-story
  - If it’s a modification to existing behavior: *execute-checklist change-checklist.md
  - After drafting the story: *execute-checklist story-draft-checklist.md → *execute-checklist story-dod-checklist.md
  - For larger initiatives/PRDs: *document-project or *create-doc prd-tmpl.yaml
  - Want me to run *advanced-elicitation now?
